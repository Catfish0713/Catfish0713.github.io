This is the answer to hw4 [p8105](https://p8105.com/homework_4.html).
But you can also learn more about me by navigating to different pages:

* [Hobby](about.html) page introducing my life and hobby

* [project](projects.html) page giving your academic and professional experience

* [plotly](plotly.html) page is the html of code and conclusion for dashboard(not dashboard).

**The site navigation for my GitHub account, my email, and other professional networks are on the top.**
